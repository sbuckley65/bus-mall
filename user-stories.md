#Bus Mall User Stories

##Marketing Research
Marketing wants a site the exposes users to 20 new products during a focus group exercise.  They want the users to be able to see three of the products at a time, and vote by clicking the image of the product.  The users should see 25 sets of three images.  If the user is having fun, then there should be an option for them to do 10 more rounds of voting.  It's OK to see an image more than once.  Marketing wants stats on  how many votes images receive, and the percentage of votes. At the end the “game” the users should see the above mentioned stats.

##Developer
The developer wants to create a web site that will display the three items side-by-side, and provide instructions to the user.  

The program should hold the pictures in an initial array.  A constructor will take the following parameters: name, file path, number of times the pictures are display, and number of times they are clicked.  A random number generator will pick the three pictures to display and make sure there are no repeats per single viewing.  The collected data will be stored and then calculations used to provide the stats marking wants to have.

##Focus Group Participant
The participant  volunteered to be part of the focus group, but is looking for to a fun experience.  Therefore, the program should feel like a fun game.
